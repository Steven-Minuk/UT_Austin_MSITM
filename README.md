# UT_Austin_MSITM

Hello all,

First of all, I would like to ask you a favor.
Basically, I made this repository by preparing Master's of Science, IT and Management at UT Austin. 
However, all the challenges in this repository are from the HackerRank. 
Therefore, I would like to ask you to consider them just as a code for challenges by not limiting them to admissions.

There are 2 folders which are 'Programming' and 'SQL' just like the 'Test Your Skills' section from MSITM admissions.
In the 'Programming' folder, there are 'Birthday Chocolate', 'Sock Merchant', 'Electronics Shop', and 'Library Fine'.
In the 'SQL' folder, there are 'Higher than 75 Marks', 'Top Earners', 'Average Population of Each Continent', and 'Top Competitors'. 

In terms of programming challenges, I used Python because these challenges do not involve much data type struggle and I am familiar with Python.


In terms of SQL challenges, I used MySQL because I am familiar with MySQL than other SQL languages. 
To create perfect implementable file, I got all the data from the HackerRank and made CSV file for importing, so you could see CSV file for each table.
I created all the database and tables in the 'MSITM_database.sql' file. You can see all the code for database and tables.
Also, you can see the answer for each challenge through each challenge sql file. It will also be able to implement.
